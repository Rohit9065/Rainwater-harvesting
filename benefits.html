        <h2>Benefits of Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
        <p>Rainwater harvesting offers numerous environmental and economic benefits that contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future. Here are some key advantages:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduces Demand on Groundwater:</strong> Helps preserve groundwater levels, which are crucial in regions with limited water resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Decreases Water Bills:</strong> By using stored rainwater, you can reduce reliance on municipal water, saving on water costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevents Soil Erosion and Flooding:</strong> Collecting rainwater reduces surface runoff, which can help prevent erosion and reduce the risk of flooding.</li>
            <li><strong>Provides a Backup Water Source:</strong> Stored rainwater can serve as an emergency water supply, especially in drought-prone areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Environmental Sustainability:</strong> Utilizing natural resources efficiently reduces the environmental impact of water extraction and treatment.</li>
